## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The project started with my brothe's idea of capture some data from different users and organize this data in segments. The capture of the data would need a custom page and for the data visualization, we'll need a platform to show all users and pages data in different ways. I developed one POC using ReactJS and firebase as "backend and DB". It worked until some point, but with a larger number of users, i needed to create our infrastructure using our database and API, and so i did all this alone :c. I learned a lot, i've never worked with backend applications, this was the first project on nodeJS and it was fine, i was able to do all the tasks and requirements. Down here you will find more information about the stacks that i used to build the app.
